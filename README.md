## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to understand more about back-end web development and to learn skills that will help me in the real world to manage or create websites. I am taking this course specifically now because it runs during the fall and I would prefer to graduate in a year rather than 2. Because of the way the classes are run during specific semesters, I have to jump ahead to this class before doing classes that are more in line with my knowledge. Unfourantely, this course seems much more advanced than anything I have learned so far but I going to try my best to overcome this challenge. 

## Assignment 2

I learned that server-side scripting has much more depth when it comes to interacting with the clients' web page. I also learned how we can put multiple files in our container using various methods. I was able to understand that using these methods will allow me to host multiple webpages on a single site. This is useful because most websites aren't one dimensional on one page, they span multiple pages with various types of content. In the future using docker and express to host websites like this is useful because if I run it on my own servers, I won't have to rely on third-party hosting services to contain my site. 

## Assignment 3

In this session, I learned about processing requests and updating webpages so that users can get feedback. To do this, I had to learn about how to put forms using templates so that the feedback and be seen. I also learned about GET and POST requests which are used to get information from a specified source and then to send data back and update a resource. Creating these forms will help me in the future by having the ability to collect and store data that users provide. I can also make it so that inputs have responses so that inputs aren't repeated.

## Assignment 4

This assignment taught me how to use requests and loops in a way that allows me to intake multiple inputs and store the data using express. I learned about a key function of hidden elements and the ability to templates to interact with the webpage more dynamically. In the future, I will be able to use these techniques to have pages that intake multiple inputs. Adding input validation would allow for more complex things to be processed. This also allowed me understand the differences between GET and POST requests a bit more and why they are used in certain cases.
