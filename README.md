## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to understand more about back-end web development and to learn skills that will help me in the real world to manage or create websites. I am taking this course specifically now because it runs during the fall and I would prefer to graduate in a year rather than 2. Because of the way the classes are run during specific semesters, I have to jump ahead to this class before doing classes that are more in line with my knowledge. Unfourantely, this course seems much more advanced than anything I have learned so far but I going to try my best to overcome this challenge. 

## Assignment 2

I learned that server-side scripting has much more depth when it comes to interacting with the clients' web page. I also learned how we can put multiple files in our container using various methods. I was able to understand that using these methods will allow me to host multiple webpages on a single site. This is useful because most websites aren't one dimensional on one page, they span multiple pages with various types of content. In the future using docker and express to host websites like this is useful because if I run it on my own servers, I won't have to rely on third-party hosting services to contain my site.
