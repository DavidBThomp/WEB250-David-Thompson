## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to understand more about back-end web development and to learn skills that will help me in the real world to manage or create websites. I am taking this course specifically now because it runs during the fall and I would prefer to graduate in a year rather than 2. Because of the way the classes are run during specific semesters, I have to jump ahead to this class before doing classes that are more in line with my knowledge. Unfourantely, this course seems much more advanced than anything I have learned so far but I going to try my best to overcome this challenge.
